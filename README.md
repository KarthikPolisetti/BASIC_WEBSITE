# BASIC_WEBSITE
🌐💻 Created a Basic Website! 💻🌐

Just wrapped up a simple yet functional website project as part of my learning journey! Here's what I accomplished:

1️⃣ Structured with HTML 🖋️
Built the website's foundation using HTML, adding headings, paragraphs, images, and links to create a clear and organized layout.

2️⃣ Styled with CSS 🎨
Enhanced the aesthetics by applying custom colors, fonts, spacing, and layouts. CSS really brought the design to life!

3️⃣ Interactive with JavaScript 🛠️
Added interactivity by implementing a button that displays an alert message when clicked. A small feature, but it makes the page dynamic and user-friendly!

It was a great exercise to reinforce my skills in front-end development. Excited to take on more complex projects soon! 🚀
